### 0.6.0 - 2018-04-14

* Adds support for incrementing/derementing card quantities
* Verifies that if a quantity is 1 and decremented, that it is removed from the list
* To do:
  * Need to get some help with UI improvements next
  * Add set icon next to card name
  * Add view card image functionality
  * Add copy to clipboard functionality for selected cards
  * Maybe selected card should have a quantity w/ default value 1?
  * Weird jumping when switching tabs
